# Advanced Control Test

# DeployedLink: ["https://advance-flight-control-aviatorcloud.netlify.app]

## Overview:
This test measures your psycho-motor and multi-tasking skills. Test takers are asked to adjust airspeed, heading, altitude, and slip ball coordinator at the same time to maintain the given target values.

### Primary Flight Display (PFD):
Test takers are presented with a basic Primary Flight Display (PFD), which consists of:

- Flight Director (Altitude and Heading)
- Airspeed
- Slip ball coordinator

## Flight Director:
During the test, the flight director constantly changes directions, and your target is to keep them centered at all times. If you manage to keep them in a centered position, you will be on the correct targetable heading and altitude.

The flight director is controlled by using the keyboard arrow keys or joystick.

## Airspeed:
Test takers are assigned to maintain targetable airspeed during the test. You can see the new target airspeed either by the top numbers above the airspeed tape or the magenta arrow on the speed tape. You increase speed by pressing **W** on the keyboard, and you reduce speed by pressing **S** on the keyboard.

Please Note: If your joystick has a throttle attached to it, you can configure the throttle and use it to control airspeed.

## Altitude:
You increase altitude by pressing the **+** key and reduce altitude by pressing the **-** key on the keyboard.

## Slip Ball Coordinator:
The slip ball coordinator will be displayed underneath the heading tape. Your goal is to keep the slip ball coordinator centered at all times.

The slip ball coordinator is controlled by the letters **A** and **D** on the keyboard, or you can also use rudder pedals to control the movement of the slip ball coordinator.

The slip ball coordinator is controlled by pressing on the left and right side of the rudder pedals icon on the right side of the screen.

## Score:
The slip ball coordinator is controlled by pressing on the left and right side of the rudder pedals icon on the right side of the screen.

We strongly recommend that test takers use a joystick and rudder pedals for practicing this software.
